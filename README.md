# Shapley indices library


## TODO list
- Implement all the indices
	- Total order Sobol
- Try to estimate the sobol indices from Mara & Tarantola, using a classical pick and freeze estimator.
- Cythonize some parts?
- Unique compute_indices_function in Indices class that works for kriging too.
- Create few unitest functions
	- On additive Gaussian model with correlation
